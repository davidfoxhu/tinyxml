tinyxml on airplay
==================

This module can be used to build the tinyxml library into airplay
applications.

The source is downloaded and compiled unmodified from sourceforge.net/projects/tinyxml/

    tinyxml_2_5_3.tar.gz

The included example xmltest.mkb will build the lib and run simple tests.

The structure of this module shows how local modifications can be stored and used with updated source distributions.
The upstream directory contents are copied to the modified directory but without overwriting existing files.
